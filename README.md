# Teleporter-for-MSC
This is a mod for My Summer Car which allows you to teleport in the most common locations on the map.

# How to download
In order to use the mod you need to download the application called MSCLoader. Link: https://github.com/piotrulos/MSCModLoader

To download the mod you can either go to: https://www.nexusmods.com/mysummercar/mods/4480?tab=description  and download it from there `or` if you want to download it from `here` you need to go to [1.1 Release](https://github.com/lemoncho57/Teleporter-for-MSC/releases/tag/release_1.1) and from there download the file `Teleporter.dll` and put it into the My Summer Car mods folder.

# How to use

To open the teleporter menu press the default keybind which is `slash`, but I recommend to change it from the mod's settings to something like `control + slash`. And from there a box with buttons should pop up and if you click on one of the buttons for example `HOME` it's going to teleport you to the player's home.
